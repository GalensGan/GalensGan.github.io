在 Github 上发现一个开源轻巧的 MVVM 框架，发现网上缺少相应的中文文档，便进行了翻译总结，英文水平有限，MVVM也才初学，若有错误，还请斧正。

Stylet is a minimal, but powerful, MVVM framework inspired by [Caliburn.Micro](http://caliburnmicro.com/). Its intention is to cut down on the complexity and magic even further,  to allow people (coworkers) unfamiliar with any MVVM framework to get up to speed more quickly.

It also provides features not available in Caliburn.Micro, including  its own IoC container, easy ViewModel validation, and even an  MVVM-compatible MessageBox.

The low LOC count and very comprehensive test suite makes it an  attractive option for projects where using and validating/verifying SOUP comes with a high overhead, which its modular toolkit-inspired  architecture means it's easy to use just the bits you like, or replace  the bits you don't.

A brief feature list is shown below. Follow the links on the right to learn more.
